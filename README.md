## Overview

This git repository serves as platform for information, sharing course
material, communication and submission of course work.

Students of the class shall work on five assignments
and---enentually---a team project. The assignments are generally
described in README files in the subdirectories A'n'; submission is
generally done via git/Github.

The warm up assignment in subdirectory A0 demos this scheme and
explains the submission via Gitub (including preparations). Follow
this assignment to get started.

Feel free to discuss via Pull request comments (in particular,
assignment specific stuff) or GitHub issues for all more general
things.
